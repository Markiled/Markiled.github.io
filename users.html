				<h2 class="center">User Interviews</h2>
				<img src="Images/user interviews.png" class="pic center">
				<p>The significance of the user interviews done throughout the user research process was to help determine what kind of content would be most beneficial to my website. I decided the types of questions I would ask by thinking about the portfolio website from the perspective of a hiring manager or someone else who would potentially be interested in hiring someone with my skills and talents. In my particular case, these people would be game developers, and since I am an aspiring Game Artist then I chose questions that would allow me to see what kinds of drawings I should prioritize on my website.</p>

				<h2 class="center">Competitor Analysis</h2>
				<img src="Images/competitor analysis.png" class="pic center">
				<p>Competitor analysis is taking the websites or applications of your peers or various companies which are similar to what you are attempting to create and evaluating the different features from their sites to highlight their strong and weak points to help you develop your own site. I chose to analyze the portfolios of other 2D Game Artists because they are basically my direct competition when it comes to finding employment and such. However, I decided to review the portfolio websites of artists who are already established and have worked on bigger game titles, because I felt that it would be more productive to analyze and potentially mimic the sites of those who are already industry professionals.</p>

				<h2 class="center">Feature Value Matrix</h2>
				<img src="Images/feature value matrix.png" class="pic center">
				<p>The feature value matrix lays out the various functions of your website or application and allows you to rank them using numbers in a way that is easy to visualize which features are a priority and which are not so important to your site as a whole. I selected my various features mainly because they are the standard in terms of what someone would expect when visiting the portfolio website of an artist.</p>

				<br>
				<h2 class="center">Feature Prioritization</h2>
				<img src="Images/feature prioritization.png" class="pic center">
				<p>I prioritized my features based on what hiring managers or indie game developers would look for most when visiting my website. Because it is an art portfolio, showcasing my artwork was at the top of my priority list; as was having a way to contact me since that is a given when you’re trying to get job offers. The rest of the features were mostly technical things that would be able to make the interface easier to navigate.</p>

				<h1 class="center">User Testing</h1>
				<br>
				<h2 class="center">User Stories</h2>
				<img src="Images/user stories.png" class="pic center">
				<p>User stories are an important part of the user testing process because they allow you to help decide whether or not your website or application is actually something that people want to use. I created my user stories by thinking about the kinds of people who would even bother to visit the portfolio website of a Game Artist, so having some sort of game-related hiring manager and an indie game developer were obvious choices. However, I also thought about the whole pipeline of the hiring process to come up with more types of users to write stories about. For example: the interns for game companies who may help with finding new employees, peers who may be applying to the same jobs, and people who may be inspired by the artist’s work and decide to pursue game art for themselves.</p>

				<h2 class="center">Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>
				<img src="Images/cognitive walkthrough.png" class="pic center">
				<p>Cognitive walkthroughs are essentially usability tests conducted in-person where users are given tasks to complete on the website. They are immensely beneficial to the user testing process because they allow developers to witness all of the little actions and idiosyncrasies that their users perform while using the website or application. Developers are able to more easily gauge the reactions and emotions of users while they are navigating the site and whatnot. One of the main challenges that I faced when conducting my cognitive walkthroughs was dealing with users with different backgrounds and skills - professionally, technologically, and so on because they had differing expectations for the functionality of the website.</p>

				<h2 class="center">User Test</h2>
				<img src="Images/user test.png" class="pic center">
				<p>The first and second tests that I chose to do were click tests, and they involve users reading a question about the website and clicking where on the site they think that they could find an answer to that question. The first one was a very general question that allowed me to see where users would try to go to find information about me and they mostly clicked on my self-portrait and met my expectations. However, the second click test was a question more from the perspective of a potential employer, and it helped to highlight the most intriguing section of my website. The third test was a preference test that made users choose between two images to let me know which one was more aesthetically pleasing. I compared what the website looks like when having a wider or longer window, and most users chose the longer one, which I also expected.</p>

				<h1 class="center">Summary of Findings</h1>
				<br>
				<p>I was able to find out quite a bit about what people expect from portfolio websites through the user research and user testing that I conducted. The user interviews allowed me to question my peers who would be either on the side of employer or competitor for employment because I interviewed fellow artists as well as people who have led indie game projects and required my assistance as an artist. I found that being able to showcase consistency within projects and improvement between projects is very important. While I was doing all of my user research, I was able to analyze the portfolio websites of industry professionals and I noticed that much of their websites were just pictures of their artwork, because that’s really what potential employers are mainly looking for when they are going through an art portfolio. They want to see what your drawings look like, so it’s more important to show your art rather than having the site cluttered with written explanations and such for the projects and pieces that you’ve worked on. These finding allowed me to easily prioritize the simple features that went into my website.</p>
				<p>The cognitive walkthroughs and user stories and tests that I performed for the user testing portion of my website development process helped me find out more of the technical issues with my website and expectations that my users had when visiting it. Many of the problems pointed out were small and had to deal with aesthetics and formatting and consistency throughout the website. For example, logo colors and adding icons and additional pictures to populate certain pages to make them more visually appealing. The other steps of the user testing process also taught me more about accommodating different visitors and which website features they might each prioritize, such as hiring managers with resume links and contact information versus fans who just want to admire the art.</p>

				<h1 class="center">Incorporation of Findings</h1>
				<br>
				<p>Many of my findings were easily incorporated because they involved small tweaks and fixes to the code and colors. One of the most obvious examples when comparing my website to how it was for the midterm is the color of the site’s main logo and icon. I opted to change the colors to a light blue rather than green because it clashed less than the green on dark blue. I also adjusted the percentage values for the various thumbnails when they are placed right next to each other on the website so that they are more uniformed as you scroll down the page. Another small change that I made was to add lines between the different projects to help distinguish them from each other when viewing the website. I also added more images to the About page to make it easier to navigate and to make it more personable, and changed the links to open in new tabs and made small adjustments to text. I also added some inline JavaScript to my Home and About pages for copying my email address since my lack of JavaScript was something that really damaged my score on the midterm assignment.</p>
				<p>There are still many changes both from the midterm grade comments and from the comments that I received from the people involved in my user testing that I plan to incorporate into my website in the near future. For example, adding some playable demos for my previous projects would be an extremely interesting addition to my website that may help push it above the crowd. I would have to look more into embedding the game files in a way that makes them usable in the browser, such as with a game-hosting site called itch.io. I also plan to add more in terms of my use of media queries and semantic classes for the website, because those were also part of why I lost points on the midterm. My findings from the user tests also alerted me to the fact that having my website full-screen on a computer leaves a lot of empty space, which is something I am working to fix. However, this was not surprising considering I mainly adjusted the sidebar buttons, text sizes, and image sizes based on what it would look like on mobile. Though I may need to make the mobile, tablet, and PC versions drastically different in the future to improve my responsive design.</p>
